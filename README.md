# SecurePOS

University project for *Software System Engineering* course (MSc Computer Engineering) by [Federico Montini](https://github.com/FedericoMontini98), [Veronica Torraca](https://github.com/veronicator), [Riccardo Sagramoni](https://github.com/RiccardoSagramoni), [Federica Perrone](https://github.com/Fedeperrone98) e [Fabrizio Lanzillo](https://github.com/FabrizioLanzillo).

Development of a pipelined application (a **secure POS monitoring system**), based on *DataOps* approach, to support productivity metrics.

The main focus of the project was to master the **AGILE methodology** (Trello, Clockify) and the **Unified Process** during all the project phases: requirements (workflow landscape, BPMN diagrams), analysis (detailed use cases, sequence diagrams, class diagrams), design (class diagram), development (Python code) and testing.
